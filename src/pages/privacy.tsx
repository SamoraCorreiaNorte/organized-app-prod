      Your information might be transferred to servers outside your country due
      to the use of essential global services required for the app to function,
      such as synchronization (optional) and authorization. This occurs only if
      you choose to use the data synchronization feature. Even when this
      happens, all data is securely encrypted, making it inaccessible to anyone,
      including the service provider, us, or any third party.

      If you&apos;re using data synchronization within or between congregations
      (for example, sharing outgoing speakers lists), the data remains
      accessible only to authorized individuals within your congregation or the
      receiving congregation. This complies with GDPR regulations, ensuring your
      data is protected. Rest assured, we take strong precautions to safeguard
      your data and comply with all relevant privacy laws, regardless of where

      We are committed to protecting your interactions with our Products and
      Services by implementing robust security measures. This includes:
      <ul style={{ margin: 0, paddingLeft: '1.5em' }}>
        <li>
          SSL/TLS Protection: All data transmitted between your device and our
          servers is secured using SSL/TLS encryption.
        </li>
        <li>
          End-to-End Encryption: All congregation data is protected with
          end-to-end encryption by default. Data is encrypted before being
          synced or sent to our servers using Google Firebase, ensuring that
          even if intercepted, it cannot be accessed without the encryption key.
          For enhanced security, elders and ministerial servants have additional
          layers of encryption. Data is encrypted with the congregation’s key
          and is stored only if synchronization within the congregation is
          enabled. Without the proper encryption keys, the data remains
          inaccessible, even if physical access is gained.
        </li>
        <li>
          App PIN Code: Users can secure their accounts with a personal PIN code
          for added protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): We offer two-factor authentication to
          provide an extra layer of security every time when accessing your
          account.
        </li>
        <li>
          One-Time Invitation Code: Access to the app can be secured with
          one-time invitation codes to ensure that only authorized users can
          join.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advanced User Access Control: We implement advanced user access
          controls to manage permissions and ensure that any data is only
          accessible by authorized individuals.
